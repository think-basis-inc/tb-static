					<description><![CDATA[Start thinking about where you're going to play, what can you be the best at? Answer these questions. What can you be the best at? What can your practice do better than all of your competitors? And importantly on the back of that, is that something that the market wants? Because you can be really great at shining toenails, but if nobody wants to buy toenail shining, it's irrelevant. Okay? So think about that. What is it that you can be the best at? What can your practice be the best that that your clients actually want, need, and deserve to get from you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you as a physician don't know how to bring that conversation down to the level of the purchaser, you are doing yourself a disservice. This is where the influencer marketing comes in because it really is in their words. It's their understanding. They're using the same vernacular, the same language. The reviewer or the influencer was going to be another mother of two that's got to go to soccer practice and she just happens to have a YouTube channel and she's going to talk to that mother in a way that you will not be able to. It will be absolutely impossible for you to connect on the same level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is where you can start thinking about the strategy of your practice. When I say strategically is you need to look at your practice and how it's going to impact it and what stage it's at. If you need to take the beach versus take the stronghold tactically and strategically in order to win the war, you have to look at it. So what stage of this battle are you in? What part of the war are you engaged in that you need to move forward?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want you to get a handle on your mindset and your limiting beliefs. So this podcast is going to be all about the way that you think, all about the way that you are holding yourself back, and ultimately it's going to be about accountability. I want to keep you accountable. I've seen too many doctors fall into the victim mentality where they'll start blaming everyone from their staff, to the marketing companies, to the economy, anything they can think of just to avoid taking responsibility for the fact that they are in charge of their own practice, they are the masters of their own destiny, and I want you to get that you are in charge of your future and it's your responsibility to move yourself forward.]]></description>
